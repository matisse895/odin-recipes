<p><h3><strong>Method</strong></h3></p>
<p><ol><li><h4>Put pasta water on to boil</h4>
          <p>Put a large pot of salted water on the stovetop on high heat.<br>It can take a while fora large pot to come to a boil,<br> so prepare sauce while the water is heating.</p></li>
       <li><h4>Brown the ground beef</h4>
      <p> In a large skillet, heat 2 tsp olive oil on medium high heat and add ground beef.<br>Cook until brown on all sides. Remove meat from pan and set aside.</p></li>
       <li><h4>Cook the bell pepper, onions, garlic, add back the beef</h4>
       <p>Add diced pepper and onions to skillet.<br>
       Cook for 4-5 minutes, until the onions are translucent and the peppers are soft. Add minced garlic<br>
       and cook half a minute more. <br>
       Return the browned beef to the pan. Stir to combine, reduce heat to low, cook for another 5 minutes.</p></li>
       <li><h4>Transfer to a medium sized pot, add tomatoes and remaining sauce ingredients to build the sauce.</h4>
       <p> Transfer the beef mixture to a medium pot. Add the crushed tomato, tomato sauce, and tomato paste to the pot.<br>
           Add the parsley, oregano, and Italian seasonings,adjustingthe amounts to taste. Sprinkle with garlic powder and/or garlic salt, to taste.<br>
           Sprinkle with red or white vinegar. Stir in sugar, a tablespoon at a time, tasting after each addition. <br>
           Add salt to taste. Don't forget that later you'll be adding Parmesan, which is salty.<br>
           Bring the sauce to a simmer and then lower the heat to maintain a low simmer. Cook for 15 to 45 minutes, stirring often. Scrape the bottom of the pot.<br>
           Remove from heat.</p></li>
       <li><h4>Boil and drain the lasagna noodles</h4>
       <p>By now the salted water should be boiling. Add the dry lasagna noodles and cook them to al dente, per package directions.<br>
       Stir often to prevent from sticking. Make sure that water remains at a full rolling boil during the entire cooking process to prevent noodles from sticking.<br>
       when ready, drain in a colander and rinse with cool water, gently separating any noodles that may be sticking together.<br>
       Spread a little olive oil on a large rimmed baking sheet, and lay out the cooked noodles on this sheet, turning them over so they get coated with oil.<br>
       This will prevent them from sticking together.</p></li>
       <li><h4>Head the oven to 375 degrees F<h4></li>
       <li><h4>Assemble the lasagna</h4>
        <p>In a 9x13-inch casserole or lasagna dish, ladle a cup of sauce and spread it over the bottom of the dish. Arrange one layer of lasagna noodles lenghtwise over the sauce. Ladle a third of the remaining sauce over the noodles.<br>
        Sprinkle a layer of a third of  the grated mozzarella on topof lasagna sauce. Add half of the ricotta cheese by placing cheese dollops every couple inches. Sprinkle half the grated Parmesan cheese evenly over the top of the ricotta.<br>
        Apply second layer of noodles, rop it with half of the remaining sauce. Add half of the remaining mozzerella, ricotta and parmesan each.<br>
        Finish with another layer of noodles. Spread the remaining sauce over thetop layer of noodles and sprinkle with the remaining mozzerella.<br>
</p></li>
       <li><h4>Bake</h4>
       <p>Cover the pan with aluminum foil, tented slightly so it doesn't touch noodles or sauce.Bake at 375 for 45 minutes. Uncover in the last 10 minutes if you want a crusty top or edges.</p></li>
       <li><h4>Cool and serve</h4>
       <p>Allow the lasagna to cool at least 15min before serving. Leftovers will keep 5 days. Leave foil on for storage.</p></li></ol>
